# Kogasa's Nechronica implementation
(Note: This is as much a learning experience as it is something serious, so abandon hope, ye who hoped for clean codes.)

FoundryVTT system for Nechronica, as the old Nechronica system for FoundryVTT has not been updated at all.
A side focus is an easier data presentation for streaming purposes (ie tracking damaged parts).
This is a fresh start, separate from the other project, at the time of writing.
Goal is simple: Get something that can display characters and potentially the damage they are taking on screen for easier streaming experience.
No automation or other data implementations are planned at this time.
